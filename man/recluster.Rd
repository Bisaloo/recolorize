\usage{
recluster(
  recolorize.obj,
  color.space = "Lab",
  ref.white = "D65",
  similarity_cutoff = 60,
  n_final = NULL,
  plot_hclust = FALSE,
  resid = FALSE,
  plot_final = TRUE,
  color.space.fit = "sRGB"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{recolorize.obj}{A recolorize object from \code{\link{recolorize}},
\code{\link{recluster}}, or \code{\link{imposeColors}}.}

\item{color.space}{Color space in which to cluster centers, passed to
\code{\link{grDevices}{convertColor}}. One of "sRGB", "Lab", or "Luv".
Default is "Lab", a perceptually uniform (for humans) color space.}

\item{ref.white}{Reference white for converting to different color spaces.
D65 (the default) corresponds to standard daylight.}

\item{similarity_cutoff}{Numeric similarity cutoff for grouping color centers
together. The range is in absolute Euclidean distance in CIE Lab space,
which means it is greater than 0-100, but cutoff values between 20 and 80
will usually work best. See details.}

\item{n_final}{Final number of desired colors; alternative to specifying
a similarity cutoff. Overrides \code{similarity_cutoff} if provided.}

\item{plot_hclust}{Logical. Plot the hierarchical clustering tree for
color similarity? Helpful for troubleshooting a cutoff.}

\item{resid}{Logical. Get final color fit residuals with
\code{\link{colorResiduals}}?}

\item{plot_final}{Logical. Plot the final color fit?}

\item{color.space.fit}{Passed to \code{\link{imposeColors}}. What
color space should the image be reclustered in?}
}
\value{
An \code{\link{imposeColors}} object with the re-fit color centers.
}
\description{
Color mapping (as with k-means or binning) often requires over-clustering in
order to recover details in an image. This can result in larger areas of
relatively uniform color being split into multiple colors, or in regions with
greater variation (due to lighting, shape, reflection, etc) being split into
multiple colors. This function clusters the color centers by visual
similarity (in CIE Lab space), then returns the re-clustered object. Users
can either set a similarity cutoff or a final number of colors. See examples.
}
\details{
This function is fairly straightforward: the RGB color centers of the
recolorize object are converted to CIE Lab color space (which is
approximately perceptually uniform for human vision), clustered using
\code{\link[stats]{hclust}}, then grouped using \code{\link[stats]{cutree}}.
The resulting groups are then passed as the assigned color centers to
\code{\link{imposeColors}}, which re-fits the \emph{original} image using the new
centers.

The similarity cutoff does not require the user to specify the final number
of colors, unlike k-means or \code{n_final}, meaning that the same cutoff could be
used for multiple images (with different numbers of colors) and produce
relatively good fits. Because the cutoff is in absolute Euclidean distance in
CIE Lab space for sRGB colors, the possible range of distances (and therefore
cutoffs) is from 0 to >200. The higher the cutoff, the more dissimilar colors
will be grouped together. There is no universally recommended cutoff; the
same degree of color variation due to lighting in one image might be
biologically relevant in another.

\examples{
# get an image
corbetti <- system.file("extdata/corbetti.png", package = "recolorize")

# too many color centers
recolored_corbetti <- recolorize(corbetti, bins = 3)

# just enough!
# check previous plot for clustering cutoff
recluster.obj <- recluster(recolored_corbetti,
                           similarity_cutoff = 60,
                           plot_hclust = TRUE)

# compare to the result using k-means clustering and the same n:
kmeans.fit <- recolorize(corbetti, "k", n = 6)
# (you also get different clusters every time you run this)

# a cutoff that's too severe will usually just produce "light",
# "dark", and "other" colors:
recluster.obj <- recluster(recolored_corbetti,
                           similarity_cutoff = 100,
                           plot_hclust = TRUE)

# we get the same result by specifying n_final = 6
recluster.obj <- recluster(recolored_corbetti,
                           n_final = 6,
                           plot_hclust = TRUE)
