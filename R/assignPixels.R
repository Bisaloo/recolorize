# Assigns a 2d matrix of pixels to a provided set of clusters
# input:
# 1. 2d pixel matrix (rows = px and cols = channels)
# 2. clusters (rows = centers and cols = channels)
# output:
# a vector of length = nrow(pixels) of the cluster to which that pixel was assigned
# kmeans does this automatically!
