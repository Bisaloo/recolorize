Description: Functions for recoloring images based on various
    color binning schemes. Eventually for use going between
    patternize, pavo, colordistance, etc. The idea is to simplify
    the colors of an image according to a metric that is useful for
    the user. You put in a binning scheme, an image, and (optional)
    a background masking condition. You get out a recolored image
    and a color palette with (optional) the proportion of pixels
    assigned to each color.
